# Design Pattern

### self practice for dp
1. `abstract factory` can initialize object from different ways without break origin code. 

  Really a good way to produce objects so it's called factory pattern.
  
  Because the factories is abstract, don't need params like factory pattern.
  
  ~~~
example: produce gift for girls.
~~~

2. `factory` can initialize object from different params.

  But everytime you want a new type of object, inserting new code would be done, which is not expected.
  
  ~~~
  example: produce too. params and enum ways.
  ~~~

3. `strategy' to be continued

## I wish i can keep on coding contiuous ~~
