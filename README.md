### self practice for dp
1. `abstract factory` can init object from different ways without break origin code. 

  Really a good way to produce objects so it's called factory pattern.
  
  Because the factories is abstract, don't need params like factory pattern.

2. `factory` to be continued

## I wish i can keep on coding contiuous ~~
